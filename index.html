                Einstein was asked to be the president of Israel, but he declined: After Chaim Weizmann, Israel's
                first
                president, died in 1952, the country's prime minister offered the job to Einstein.Einstein died after
                refusing surgery, saying, "I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I
                have
                done my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly."Einstein was a member of the NAACP, drawing
                correlations between Black people in America and Jews in Germany. He believed racism was a disease.

            <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
            <i>Albert Einstein was a physicist who developed the general theory of
              relativity. He is considered one of the most influential scientists
              of the 20th century.</i>

              <h4>Who Was Albert Einstein?</h4>
              <hr>
              <p>
                Albert Einstein was a German mathematician and physicist who developed the special and general
                theories of
                relativity. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric
                effect.
                In the following decade, he immigrated to the U.S. after being targeted by the German Nazi Party.
                <br /><br>
                His work also had a major impact on the development of atomic energy. In his later years, Einstein
                focused
                on unified field theory. With his passion for inquiry, Einstein is generally considered the most
                influential physicist of the 20th century.

              <h4>Education</h4>
              <hr>
              <p>Einstein was eventually able to gain admission into the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in
                Zurich,
                specifically due to his superb mathematics and physics scores on the entrance exam.
                <br><br> He was still required to complete his pre-university education first, and thus attended a
                high school
                in
                Aarau, Switzerland helmed by Jost Winteler. Einstein lived with the schoolmaster's family and fell in
                love
                with Winteler's daughter, Marie. Einstein later renounced his German citizenship and became a Swiss
                citizen at the dawn of the new century.

              <h4>Inventions and Discoveries</h4>
              <hr>
              <p>
                As a physicist, Einstein had many discoveries, but he is perhaps best known for his theory of
                relativity
                and the equation E=MC<sup>2</sup>, which foreshadowed the development of atomic power and the atomic
                bomb.<br><br>
                Einstein first proposed a special theory of relativity in 1905 in his paper, “On the Electrodynamics
                of
                Moving Bodies,” taking physics in an electrifying new direction. By November 1915, Einstein completed
                the
                general theory of relativity. Einstein considered this theory the culmination of his life research.
                <br><br>
                He was convinced of the merits of general relativity because it allowed for a more accurate prediction
                of
                planetary orbits around the sun, which fell short in Isaac Newton’s theory, and for a more expansive,
                nuanced explanation of how gravitational forces worked.
                <br><br>
                Einstein's assertions were affirmed via observations and measurements by British astronomers Sir Frank
                Dyson and Sir Arthur Eddington during the 1919 solar eclipse, and thus a global science icon was born.
                <br><br>
                Einstein’s 1905 paper on the matter/energy relationship proposed the equation E=MC<sup>2</sup>: the
                energy
                of a body (E) is equal to the mass (M) of that body times the speed of light squared (C<sup>2</sup>).
                This
                equation suggested that tiny particles of matter could be converted into huge amounts of energy, a
                discovery that heralded atomic power. <br><br>

                Famed quantum theorist Max Planck backed up the assertions of Einstein, who thus became a star of the
                lecture circuit and academia, taking on various positions before becoming director of the Kaiser
                Wilhelm
                Institute for Physics (today is known as the Max Planck Institute for Physics) from 1917 to 1933.

              <h4>Nobel Prize for Physics</h4>
              <hr>
              <p>In 1921, Einstein won the Nobel Prize for Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect,
                since
                his ideas on relativity were still considered questionable. He wasn't actually given the award until
                the
                following year due to a bureaucratic ruling, and during his acceptance speech, he still opted to speak
                about relativity. <br><br>

                In the development of his general theory, Einstein had held onto the belief that the universe was a
                fixed,
                static entity, aka a "cosmological constant," though his later theories directly contradicted this
                idea
                and asserted that the universe could be in a state of flux. <br><br>

                Astronomer Edwin Hubble deduced that we indeed inhabit an expanding universe, with the two scientists
                meeting at the Mount Wilson Observatory near Los Angeles in 1931.</p>

              <h4>Einstein’s Brain</h4>
              <hr>
              During Einstein’s autopsy, pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed his brain, reportedly without his
              family's consent, for preservation and future study by doctors of neuroscience. <br><br>

              However, during his life, Einstein participated in brain studies, and at least one biography claimed he
              hoped researchers would study his brain after he died. Einstein's brain is now located at the Princeton
              University Medical Center. In keeping with his wishes, the rest of his body was cremated and the ashes
              scattered in a secret location. <br><br>

              In 1999, Canadian scientists who were studying Einstein’s brain found that his inferior parietal lobe, the
              area that processes spatial relationships, 3D-visualization and mathematical thought, was 15 percent wider
              than in people who possess normal intelligence. According to The New York Times, the researchers believe
              it may help explain why Einstein was so intelligent.
